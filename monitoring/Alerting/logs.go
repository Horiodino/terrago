// To be proactive about detecting and resolving issues, it's important to set up alerting rules based on metrics and events. You can use tools such as Alertmanager or PagerDuty to send alerts to your team when certain thresholds are exceeded or when critical events occur.

// let's define the alerting rules for the monitoring

// we will define the alerting rules for the monitoring which will include the following
// we will define the alerting rules for the monitoring for the cpu usage, memory usage, disk usage, etc
// we will define the alerting rules for the monitoring for the billing

// first of all we will get the logs from the monitoring
// we will get the logs from the monitoring for the cpu usage, memory usage, disk usage, etc
// and then we will define the alerting rules for the monitoring for the cpu usage, memory usage, disk usage, etc

//now we will define the alerting rules for the monitoring for the cpu usage, memory usage, disk usage, etc

// for cpu usage
func cpualert() {
	// we will define the alerting rules for the monitoring for the cpu usage as per the guidelines

	// now get the struct slice of the cpu usage from metrices.go
	monitoring.cpu()
