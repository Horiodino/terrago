package main

//in this file we will define the monitoring part of the cluster and all its components
// and we will give it to the webserver to display it

// defining the monitoring struct
// in this struct we will define all the monitoring components

// as we are using the Azure SDK for Go, we also need to fetcht the info regarding the cluster
// its components and the monitoring components so we will import the cluster.go file

// also we will define the monitoring components for the cluster components such as the cpu usage for the nodes, memory usage for the nodes, etc

// we will also define the billing part as per azure billing
// how we will get our bill for the cluster and its components
// we will use the azure billing API for this

// we also gona define the biling on hourly basis and monthly basis

// lets start our journey ;)

// for monitoring what thing we need to monitor
// we need to monitor the cluster and its components
// how can we fetch the info regarding the cluster and its components

// we gona deploy our app inside the cluster
// so we need to get the kubeconfig file for the cluster

// we will verify the cluster and its components and we will get the info regarding the cluster and its components

// we will get the info regarding the cluster and its components
// we willget the matrecies for the cluster and its components

// we will get all the info regarding the cluster and its components , our app installed inside the cluster
// and another webserver which will display the info regarding the cluster and its components
// that will be on the internet so we use some kind of verification for the webserver
// we need to connect our webserver to the app inside the cluster
// how we will do that
